check if testingbtye is 0, because builtin_clz is undefined for all 0s
    if the second bit is 1, it is just a spacer between variables and cannot be used
        move left by one
        increment index
    if there are suffucient leading 0s, -2 for the spacers, for the size
        return it's index +1 (for the spacer)
    otherwise
